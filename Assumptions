Assumptions

1	On Super Tuesday, for Ted user, if itâ€™s the 5th ticket, then the ticket is free and it's not on 50% discount
2	On Super Tuesday, for Ted user the discount is 50% and 10% is not applicable
3	There is no limit on the number of tickets booked by a single user
4	Same user is not allowed to login from two IPs
5	A seat gets locked if a user has selected the seat and moved on to checkout. If payment failed, seat should be available again
6	Supported Browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE11
7	Password is encripted and token is returned. User is logged out after 10 minutes


Edge cases
1   After payment is done, but payment status is "Pending", seat should be reserved until correct response is received
2   Maximum tickets a user can book is 50 (as no more seats are available).
3   Changing the seat count at seat selection/payment page in underlying DOM elements.
